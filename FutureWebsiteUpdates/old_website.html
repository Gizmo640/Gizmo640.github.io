	<h2>Variable Pitch Drone Propeller System</h2>
	<p>The goal of this project is to build and test a prototype of a variable-pitch drone propeller system.
		A variable pitch system is one where the angle of the blades can be controlled by the pilot.
		These systems are already being used in helicopters to make taking off and landing softer and more gradual.
		This project is about taking that principle and adding it to a drone for the same reasons,
		to make take-off and landing more gradual and less jerky.</p>

	<p>This would help the avionics industry by making the idea of delivering drones a more plausible way to deliver
		packages.
		As drones are now, there is an extreme amount of jerk in take-off and landing, this can cause damages to the
		packages.
		Making the amount of lift that the propeller produces zero as it ramps up to speed;
		then once it reaches its set speed starts gradually increasing the amount of lift will make lift off a lot
		smoother.</p>
	<h2>Reference Ethics</h2>
	<h3>Ethics Essay</h3>

	<p>Ethics are the socially accepted ideologies that dictate if an action is right or wrong.
		Different ethics drive different behaviors depending on the field; for a spy, it is ethical to lie, kill, and
		steal.
		That is different for a multitude of other jobs.
		As engineers, we not only need to think about how to apply math and physics in our work but also how what we are
		creating can be used and exploited.</p>
	<p>The purpose of having a code of ethics is to give all engineers a shared responsibility to hold each other
		accountable for following it.
		It gives a fundamental moral code to conduct yourself as an engineer. Having a code of ethics gives us a
		reliable framework on which to base our decisions.</p>
	<p>Some ethical issues that have come up recently are with self-driving cars and whose life to prioritize in case of
		an emergency.
		As shown in the past, car companies have failed numerous times to abide by a proper code of ethics.
		There was the case with Volkswagen changing its engine tuning during the emission test and Ford signing off on
		the Pinto even though it could not pass the crash test. My group discussed both cases, and we found that in both
		cases, there were multiple ethics violations. From the IEEE disclosure of information on faulty equipment to
		putting the public's health in harm's way.
		When an engineer works on a project, that engineer is responsible for any consequences that will come of that
		project.</p>
	<p>In both cases, the engineers on those projects failed more than half, if not all, of the virtues of ethics. They
		did not display integrity when they failed to choose to be ethical. They were not honest when they lied about
		the car's emissions or said it passed the crash test. They were not responsible when they put other people's
		life at risk, and they failed at exercising fidelity when they did not say anything even though they knew they
		were doing something wrong.</p>
	<p>To be a good engineer, you do not only have to be good at applying math and physics; you also have to be ethical
		and not take advantage of the trust people put in you. </p>
