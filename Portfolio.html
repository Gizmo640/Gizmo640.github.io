				<img src="" alt="Cover Image" style="visibility: hidden;">
				<summary>
					<p>This project focuses on creating a versatile path planning system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used in outdoor exploration. The system generates a 3D navigation plan based on detected targets and wind patterns during flight. The approach involves developing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in a simulation, training it on real aerial imagery, and deploying it on a quadcopter for real-world anomaly detection.</p>

				<img src="" alt="Cover Image" style="visibility: hidden;">
				<summary>
					<p>The single-cycle CPU design for the MIPS ISA is a straightforward and efficient processor architecture where each instruction is executed within a single clock cycle. This approach simplifies the control logic and allows for predictable and consistent instruction execution times. The CPU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, performs necessary operations in an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and stores the results all within one cycle. Key components include instruction memory, a control unit, an ALU, data memory, and registers for temporary data storage.</p>

					<p>n a universe brimming with endless possibilities, the human spirit perseveres. From the simplest moments to the grandest adventures, life unfolds in mysterious and beautiful ways. People strive for purpose, build connections, and face the trials of existence. This is a story of resilience, of individuals seeking their place in a vast world, where the journey is as important as the destination.</p>

				<img src="" alt="Cover Image" style="visibility: hidden;">
				<summary>
					<p>This project focuses on making this website. I built it because I wanted a place to display my projects and work for people to see them. It also doubles as a portfolio for my engineering portfolio class. Hopefully this website will help other blossoming engineers with similar projects and inspire future engineers to make their own.</p>
