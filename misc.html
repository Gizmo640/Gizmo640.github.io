				<h3>Ethics Essay</h3>
				<p>Ethics are the socially accepted ideologies that dictate if an action is right or wrong. Different ethics drive different behaviors depending on the field; for a spy, it is ethical to lie, kill, and steal. That is different for a multitude of other jobs. As engineers, we not only need to think about how to apply math and physics in our work but also how what we are creating can be used and exploited.</p>
				<p>The purpose of having a code of ethics is to give all engineers a shared responsibility to hold each other accountable for following it. It gives a fundamental moral code to conduct yourself as an engineer. Having a code of ethics gives us a reliable framework on which to base our decisions.</p>
				<p>Some ethical issues that have come up recently are with self-driving cars and whose life to prioritize in case of an emergency. As shown in the past, car companies have failed numerous times to abide by a proper code of ethics. There was the case with Volkswagen changing its engine tuning during the emission test and Ford signing off on the Pinto even though it could not pass the crash test. My group discussed both cases, and we found that in both cases, there were multiple ethics violations. From the IEEE disclosure of information on faulty equipment to putting the public's health in harm's way. When an engineer works on a project, that engineer is responsible for any consequences that will come of that project.</p>
				<p>In both cases, the engineers on those projects failed more than half, if not all, of the virtues of ethics. They did not display integrity when they failed to choose to be ethical. They were not honest when they lied about the car's emissions or saying it passed the crash test. They were not responsible when they put other people's life at risk, and they failed at exercising fidelity when they did not say anything even though they knew they were doing something wrong.</p>
				<p>To be a good engineer, you do not only have to be good at applying math and physics; you also have to be ethical and not take advantage of the trust people put in you.</p>

				<h3>A Reflective Journey: Navigating Your Cumulative Experience at Iowa State University</h3>
				<p>To be completely frank, I believe that my time here at Iowa State University could have been spent more wisely. I do not hold the university accountable; it is the fault of the association that oversees the qualifications of an adequate engineering program. I think that it would be more beneficial for us as students and as engineers to spend less time taking classes that do not remotely apply to the route or specialization that we would like to pursue. This time could be spent delving into topics in our specific focus to a far greater extent so we will be able to understand and learn the material that we find interesting to a much better degree. This, in turn, will make us far more effective in our chosen field.</p>
				<p>It is my belief that the Electrical Engineering Program at Iowa State University, as it is now, is set up more as a factory to produce as many engineers as possible in the shortest amount of time. Because of this, the program is sacrificing true learning and understanding of the material. This could be more the fault of the professors in the program, but it is ultimately the program and the university as a whole that is responsible for managing its professors. I think that some classes would be better taught across a whole year instead of jammed into a semester. This would lighten the workload of the students, allowing them to explore the concepts on their own, as I have tried to do over my college career. Exploring the concepts we are learning in class should be the whole focus because this better develops our understanding, critical thinking skills, and creativity, which will allow us to more challenging problems more effectively and efficiently.</p>
